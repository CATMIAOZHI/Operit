const guide = String.raw`
DECIDE FIRST
Reading this guide does not oblige you to create a block. If Markdown explains the answer well,
answer in Markdown and call nothing else. Typical no-UI requests: definitions ("what is X"),
opinions, short facts, code changes, plain lists. Typical UI requests: multi-step processes,
several numbers over time or across categories, records with many attributes, parameters to try.

WHAT THIS IS
Native rich content embedded INSIDE your normal answer, not a separate card app. Each reference
renders as a borderless block exactly where you place it between Markdown paragraphs, using the
chat theme. One answer may hold several blocks: text -> flow -> text -> chart/table -> text.

HTML/CSS VISUALS
STRICT OPT-IN: only use Html, prepare_html or the surfaces example when the user explicitly requests
advanced visual effects or HTML/CSS. A generic request for a card, diagram, attractive layout or icons
does NOT authorize HTML. Use native components by default. Never substitute HTML for a native error.
The user sees "This is an HTML card. Tap to load." first; no WebView is created before that tap.
Offscreen/background visuals are destroyed; they reload on return and local CSS state resets.
For custom gradients, patterns, glass-like layers or CSS animations, use prepare_html(label,html,css).
It returns the same a2ui-ref placement as a native card. Supply a body fragment plus CSS; no document
wrapper, JS, scripts, frames, forms, links, remote images/fonts or network requests. Inline SVG
basic shapes, details/summary, and radio/checkbox+label CSS selectors support local visual interaction.
Use native components for tool actions, AI requests, data-entry forms or persistent state.
Keep widths responsive (100%, grid minmax, media queries), avoid viewport heights/fixed page widths.
Height fits content up to max_height (120..900dp, default720), then scrolls. At most four per card.
Styles are isolated to this block: arbitrary CSS colors are allowed here. Use --operit-text,
--operit-surface and --operit-accent for theme defaults, or explicitly pair text with custom backgrounds.
Respect prefers-reduced-motion. Blur/backdrop-filter support depends on the installed Android WebView.
CSS toggle state lasts while the visual stays visible; it is not saved in the native card state.
read_example(name="surfaces") shows four locally switchable complex backgrounds without Javascript.
Advanced composition can use Html(label="...",html="...",css="...",maxHeight=720) inside an Express tree.
Each html/css string <=8192 characters, max256 HTML elements; source is validated before display.

CHOOSE THE LIGHTEST FORM (most blocks should be display-only)
1. Prose/Markdown when words are clear. Lists, code, short tables and math stay in Markdown.
2. Display-only UI when visual structure is clearer: Flow for steps/linear processes with arrows,
   Chart for trends/comparisons, Table for records, Grid+Display for key metrics, InfoRow for
   attributes, Badge rows for status, Vector for small custom diagrams, Image with text.
   Display-only blocks need NO $/ state, NO Event, NO Button. Never initialize unused data.
3. Interactive UI only when the user must choose, enter, filter, calculate or explore. Make only
   that part interactive and keep the rest of the block static.
Use display blocks proactively when they clarify steps, trends, comparisons or relationships.
Do not add buttons, forms, toggles or "tap to..." hints that nothing needs. Keep explanations in
Markdown around blocks rather than inside them. Trends: line; categories: bar; shares: pie;
numeric relationships: scatter. Branching or many-node graphs: Mermaid in Markdown, or Vector.
Use actual user/tool data for factual charts; label demos and assumptions. Never invent measurements.

INLINE IN PARAGRAPHS (no prepare_card)
Short status inside a sentence stays in Markdown: write the syntax directly in the paragraph.
Badge :badge[label]{tone=success icon=check} marks an evidence-backed status or result: build
passed/failed, task done/running, supported or not, risk level. Label <=16 chars (badges never wrap);
tone and icon are optional.
Icon :icon[time] is a small marker before the text it labels: ":icon[time] 2 min",
":icon[folder] /sdcard/Download", ":icon[calendar] Oct 12". Add color with :icon[check]{tone=success}.
Lucide works here too: :icon[lucide:orbit]{tone=accent size=lg}. Optional size=sm|md|lg scales to
0.85/1/1.25 times the surrounding text (default md); baseline stays centered. Icon names <=64 chars.
An icon never carries meaning alone; always follow it with text.
Example: "Build :badge[passed]{tone=success icon=check}, took :icon[time] **2 min**."
Tones and icon names as in FLOW (unknown icons are dropped). Only badges and icons go inline; buttons,
charts and layouts are blocks. Use 0-2 per answer, never as decoration. Skip them for general
explanations, hypothetical results, or when the user asks for plain text, code or JSON.
Copy and speech keep the badge label and skip icons. Never put the syntax in backticks; it would stay literal.

VISUAL RULES
Keep heading levels clear: never h1/h2 inside blocks. Display blocks introduced by prose need no title;
Header is for self-contained blocks (tools, records, live status); Heading marks a sub-section.
Repeated items use the same component, text size and order. Badges and tones carry meaning
(status, risk, result), never decoration; at most a few per block. Do not wrap summaries,
recommendations or conclusions in colored panels; write them as prose. Every Button must do
something real. Images only when they help understanding. One block per idea; avoid stacking
several blocks that repeat the same information.

FRAMING
Blocks have no border, background or padding by default and line up with paragraphs.
Do not start every block with a Header; the surrounding text usually introduces it.
Use root=Card(child=...) only for a self-contained tool or record (calculator, form, status record)
that benefits from a visible boundary. Panel groups a sub-area. Never nest frames for decoration.

PLAN THE WHOLE BLOCK BEFORE CHOOSING COMPONENTS
Start with the user's question and the information they need to see first. Arrange a short overview,
the main evidence/result, then optional controls/details in reading order. Use named declarations
for meaningful regions; keep one idea per region. Do not make a grid of unrelated boxes.
For local exploration, put the controls next to or above the result they change. Keep inputs and
their results in ONE card; identify which state path drives which text, list or chart before coding.
Store editable inputs and source records; derive totals, labels and chart values from those same
records with pure functions. Never hard-code a second total or maintain a duplicate result state.
Named declarations refer to components only; put calculations in properties (no formula aliases).
Every control must change a visible result or collect a value needed by an explicitly requested
submission. A slider/checklist/filter needs no "Ask AI" or "Apply" button for a local calculation.
Use ai_submit only for a new request requiring reasoning or external information.
Choose Row(weights=[0,1]) for a small icon beside growing text, and auto Grid(minItemWidth=160)
for comparable metrics or features. Preserve reading order when stacked. Keep essential text free
to wrap; fixed heights/Frame are for graphics, not headings, descriptions or form fields.
Before prepare_card, check the smallest/largest inputs and empty selections: no zero divisor,
mismatched chart labels/values, stale totals or button without an effect. Initial values alone
are not enough. Do not claim visual or cross-model testing merely because compilation succeeds.

LEARN A WORKING PATTERN ONLY WHEN NEEDED
Call read_example(name="shopping_list",source_only=true) for a portion slider -> derived quantities
and independent checklist state; "trip_budget" for inputs -> total and per-person cost;
"filtered_chart" for a region selector -> chart labels, values and total derived from the same rows.
These are demonstration data, not researched prices or facts. Adapt the source and call prepare_card;
never present a learning example as the user's requested result. Read one relevant example, not all.
For an explicit demo request, omit source_only to prepare that example for display.

MINIMAL DISPLAY BLOCK (no state, no actions)
root = Flow(label="Three cooking stages",steps=[{title:"Prepare",caption:"2 min",icon:"list"},
 {title:"Cook separately",caption:"4 min",icon:"fire"},{title:"Combine",caption:"1 min",icon:"check",tone:"success"}])

WORKFLOW
Read this guide, then call prepare_card(source) once per block. Place each returned a2ui-ref fence
EXACTLY where that block belongs in your answer, with prose before/after as needed. The app renders
the compiled block at that position.
Do not repeat the source/NDJSON, reconstruct the output or revalidate a successful result.
References belong to this active turn; never reuse them in another turn/chat.
Earlier cards appear in chat history as "[Dynamic UI card shown to the user here. Visible content: ...]" lines. The app
writes those summaries; never write one yourself, because only a placed a2ui-ref fence shows a card.
To revise a card from THIS turn, use update_card(reference,changes,remove?).
changes contains only named declarations to replace/add; remove lists existing declarations.
The complete merged graph is checked atomically. Inline components are changed via their named parent.
Display the NEW reference; it creates a separate revision, NOT a live edit of a displayed card.
Old cards and user inputs are preserved. New revisions start from their declared initial data.
Patch errors use merged source locations. For previous turns, prepare complete new source.
valid:false is a completed inspection: fix the reported line/column and field. Do not retry identical
input or infer unsupported nesting. Validation does not prove visual quality or arithmetic intent.
read_example prepares an unmodified demo by default; source_only=true only returns source for learning.
Custom cards are freely composed, not fixed templates.

EXPRESS (Operit named-argument subset, compiled locally to AndroidX A2UI v0.9)
One assignment per line; multiline constructors allowed. No enclosing tags or Markdown fences.
root is required. ALL component/function arguments are named: Text(text="Hello").
Inline components or reference declarations (forward references allowed):
root = Column(children=[title, Text(text="Details")])
title = Heading(text="Overview")
State bindings use absolute object paths: $/form/years. Initialize with literal assignments:
$/form = {years:4,discount:false}
No overlapping initializations, array-index paths, reserved keys, uninitialized bindings, or calls
inside initial data. Strings use JSON double quotes/escapes; numbers are decimal.
No positional args, scripts, operators, imports, lifecycle commands or remote catalogs.
All declarations must be reachable from root. No cycles. Max 128 components, 32 children/container,
depth 12; source 64K characters, compiled document 128K, initial data 32K, string 8192 characters.
Event(name="...", context={...}) describes an action, not a callback.
Local calculations: multiply(a=$/form/years,b=10), formatNumber(value=...,decimals=2,grouping=true).
Functions accept numeric strings. if evaluates eagerly; division by zero is unresolved. Use
Conditional hints and Button checks, e.g. checks=[{condition:greaterThan(a=$/form/years,b=0),
message:"Enter a positive value"}]. Bind controls' value/checked/number to initialized state.
Literal controls are read-only. Calls never write state; an explicit local_action does.

DYNAMIC LISTS
Repeat(items=$/issues,key="id",child=issueRow,maxItems=20) repeats one component template.
Initialize issues as object arrays with stable, unique nonempty string IDs (not array indexes).
Template fields use item(field="title") or item(field="author/name"); functions may consume item values.
Item data is read-only. Use item_state(field="done",default=false) for independent writable row fields.
Defaults must be scalar literals; declarations of the same field must agree. State follows Repeat ID +
stable item key across reorder/filter/reopen. Hidden rows retain state within the 32K quota.
Absolute $/ bindings still refer to shared card state. Never write the internal _operit_rows branch.
local_action {op:"row_set",repeat:"rows",key:"issue-id",field:"done",value:true} edits a declared field
of a currently present row. Removing a row rejects its old events; reusing its key restores its state.
Arrays may come from arrayFilter. Default maxItems=20, maximum32; overflow is rejected, never truncated.
Repeat can nest: inner items=item(field="children"). item/item_state always refer to the nearest row.
State includes every ancestor's stable key; the whole card shares the 512 rendered-node budget.
For nested row_set, pass parents:["outerKey",...] in outermost-first order plus the named inner Repeat ID.
Empty arrays render no rows; use Conditional for an empty-state explanation.

NATIVE INTERACTION
Pressable(label="View step",child=...,selected=booleanBinding,disabled=false,action=Event(...))
makes an entire display/layout node clickable with a 48dp minimum target and accessibility semantics.
Its descendants must be noninteractive; keep inputs, links and other buttons outside the node.
For interactive flow diagrams combine Pressable + Column/Row + Vector arrows + Conditional details.
Completed is different from disabled: completed steps remain clickable; Next depends only on position.
Input controls support onChange=Event(name="local_action",context={op:"set",path:"/selection",
value:event_value(field="value")}). event_value fields: value, previous, index (or -1 when not indexed).
Only actual changed user input fires onChange, after its bound value is saved. Initialization,
restore and programmatic state changes do not fire. onChange cannot submit to AI or call tools.
Vector shapes retain literal types/array structure; coordinates, tone, stroke, filled and text may bind
to state or calculations. arrow uses x1,y1,x2,y2 and draws its own arrowhead. All geometry remains
bounded to the viewport. Invalid runtime geometry shows a local error; no arbitrary SVG/JS.

LIVE TASK DATA
prepare_card(source,live=true) enables data-only updates during this active turn.
Initialize $/agent={...} as an object (maximum8K). Keep user inputs under other branches such as $/form.
After displaying the reference ONCE, patch_card_data(reference,expected_version=0,data={...}) replaces
the COMPLETE Agent object. Each success returns the next version; use it on the next patch.
Conflicts and invalid updates change nothing. The whole source is revalidated before publication.
User controls/local actions cannot write Agent data. Patches never execute actions or modify layout.
The final data is saved on this device, including while the card is off-screen. After this turn ends
the reference is no longer writable. update_card still creates a separate, non-live revision.
Live data and user input are included in app data backups; ordinary text exports carry initial data.
Cross-card sharing is not implicit: use multiple Panels in one card for shared controls and results.

FLOW (static steps and linear flowcharts)
Flow(label="Accessible summary",steps=[{title:"...",caption:"...",icon:"check",tone:"success"}],
direction="auto"|"horizontal"|"vertical"). 1..8 steps; title required (<=80 chars), caption <=160.
1535 Lucide v0.456.0 icons are built in. Search list_icons(query="orbit") or another English
keyword, then use the returned name, e.g. lucide:orbit, lucide:brain, lucide:music.
Prefer the lucide: prefix for an exact library match. Bare new names also work; legacy names retain
their original artwork. Do not list the whole catalog in the answer or request all pages unnecessarily.
Legacy icons: check,info,settings,person,home,star,warning,search,calendar,folder,edit,play,flag,time,list,
fire,food,code,upload,download,lock,chat,build,phone (alias smartphone),globe (alias language),
browser,computer,terminal,server,storage,cloud,extension,shield,mic,audio,image,video,document,link,
chart,science,lightbulb,robot,wifi,delete. All are native outlined vector icons; use phone for a
mobile device, globe for the internet, browser for a web page, and extension for a module.
Use these icons instead of emoji when a matching icon exists. The same names work in Icon,
Flow steps and inline :icon[...] / :badge[...]{icon=...}. calendarToday is an alias for calendar.
Example: Row(children=[Icon(name="phone"),Text(text="Operit Core")]); inline :icon[globe]{tone=info}.
Tones: neutral,accent,success,info,warning,error.
auto draws horizontal tiles with right arrows for <=4 steps when they fit, otherwise vertical tiles
with down arrows. horizontal is a preference: it still stacks vertically when tiles would not fit.
Combine several Flows in a Column/Grid for simple branches. No state or actions needed.

LAYOUT
One purpose per block. Titles are optional; prominent results, then details.
Header(text=title,label=optionalSubtitle,status=optionalBadge,tone=...) titles a self-contained block.
Heading is a smaller section heading. InfoRow(label=...,text=...) aligns each attribute/value;
long values automatically stack without truncation. Divider separates header and details.
Display(text=...,label=...,align="start") gives statistics a large value on an inset grey panel.
Default alignment is start; calculators use align="end". Badge and Text tone=
neutral, success, info, warning, error. Use colors for meaning, never as decoration.
Stack forms vertically. Table aligns tabular data; Grid suits short metrics or keypads, not prose.
Plan the whole component tree first: header (icon + title/description), body, related feature grid,
then optional detail/actions. Compose these freely; do not design a collection of fixed-pixel boxes.
Your layout values express intent; the client decides final sizes and reflow from available width,
font scale and content. Row wraps items by default instead of squeezing later text; wrap=false
prefers one line but the client still stacks the items if they do not fit.
For a logo beside growing text, use Row(weights=[0,1],children=[logo,titleColumn]).
weights is one literal integer0..12 per child: 0 uses natural width, positive values share the remaining
width. [1,1] gives equal regions; [1,2] gives the second twice the space. Weighted rows fill the width
and stack in source order when any flexible region would get less than minItemWidth (default120dp,
optional80..320, adjusted for font scale). This readability fallback also applies with wrap=false.
Panel directly inside a Row hugs its content. Use Grid for repeated feature tiles; omit columnCount
to adapt to screen width and large text. Let text determine height; never crop prose with Frame.
read_example(name="profile") demonstrates a composed header, responsive feature tiles and local
selection/details. It uses the same basic components, not a special product-card renderer.
Avoid decorative nesting and duplicating titles in the surrounding text.
gap=none|xs|sm|md|lg means 0/4/8/16/24 dp.
Row align=start|center|end is vertical; justify=start|center|end|between is horizontal.
Unweighted rows keep their content width by default; explicit justify uses the available full width.
Column align=start|center|end is horizontal. Both default to an 8 dp gap.
Panel(child=...,padding="md",radius="md",background="inset",border=false,maxWidth=600)
groups content with bounded styles. Background: transparent|surface|inset|accentMuted|light|dark|blue|green|orange|red;
info|success|warning|error are aliases for blue|green|orange|red. Colored fills follow the local light/dark
palette; light/dark explicitly choose a light-gray/deep-blue-gray panel. Text and icons inside adapt to that
panel (including nested panels), without changing the rest of the answer. radius:none|sm|md|lg.
Use read_example(name="backgrounds") for a four-color panel demo. No HEX/RGB or gradient backgrounds.
Text textAlign=start|center|end, tone=success|...; optional lineClamp=1..8 truncates nonessential text only.
Scroll(child=...,maxHeight=240) creates a bounded vertical region (80..480 dp). Avoid nested scrolling.
Blocks are frameless; see FRAMING. Keep commentary in Markdown outside the block.
Choose one primary action; quiet secondary actions. No arbitrary style/color overrides.
Grid columnCount=1..4; columnSpans needs one integer span per child, each 1..columnCount.
Without columnCount, Grid auto-fits 1..4 columns using minItemWidth (80..320 dp, default160)
and font scale. Prefer auto columns for metrics; explicit columns for keypads.
Items pack in order and incomplete rows keep empty cells. A zero key can span 2 columns.
Slider steps counts INTERMEDIATE stops: min=0,max=100,steps=99 gives integers; default continuous.
Retain decimal precision unless asked to round. Long Display values shrink to fit, then wrap; never truncated.
Text variants: h1/h2/h3/body/caption.
Icon(name="lucide:orbit",tone="accent",size=32) supports semantic tone=neutral|accent|success|info|warning|error
(can bind to local state); no tone follows surrounding content color. Literal size=12..96 dp, default24.
Size is a preference constrained by the available layout. Colors follow the theme and bubble contrast.
Bind Expandable.expanded and Tabs/Carousel.value to retain state.
Navigation value is a named child's ID; use named declarations for navigation children.
DatePicker uses yyyy-MM-dd and expands inline; minDate/maxDate bound 1900..2100.
clearable=true adds Clear (writes an empty string). Changing bounds does not rewrite existing data.
TextField/TextArea error="..." shows a field error. TextArea minLines/maxLines are 1..12 (default3/8).
TextField mask=none|password|digits: password masks DISPLAY ONLY (the value remains plain local state);
digits accepts ASCII digits only, without reformatting the stored value. No arbitrary mask patterns.
Button loading=true keeps its label and shows a spinner; clicks are blocked until loading=false.
Controls do not open Activity dialogs.
Tooltip(label="What is this?",text="Explanation") opens on tap/long-press, using the same closable
in-card overlay as Popover. Stepper(label="Steps",labels=["Start","Finish"],current=$/step)
shows connected numbered steps (zero-based integer); prior steps are shown as passed, not independent
completion flags. Past steps remain clickable and onChange is local.
Formula(label="Equation",text="\\frac{1}{2}") renders native bounded math, never arbitrary TeX.
Maximum1024 chars/64 commands/12 brace levels. Allowed: frac,sqrt,sum,prod,int,lim,infty,left,right,
alpha,beta,gamma,delta,theta,lambda,mu,pi,sigma,phi,omega,Delta,Sigma,Omega,times,cdot,div,pm,
le,leq,ge,geq,ne,neq,approx,sin,cos,tan,log,ln,exp,text,mathrm,mathbf,overline,vec,hat.
No macros, environments, external files or size commands. Express quoted strings escape backslashes.

DATA AND MEDIA
Chart type="line"|"bar"|"pie"|"scatter", labels=["A","B"], series=[{label:"Sales",values:[1,2]}].
Scatter: series=[{label:"Demo",points:[{x:1,y:2,label:"A"}]}].
Max 4 series/128 points, category lengths must agree. Pie: one nonnegative series.
Charts provide tap inspection and read their values to screen readers; do not repeat the data in a Table by default.
Table: string columns and array rows, max 8 columns/32 rows.
columnWidths=[120,180] sets one literal64..480dp width per column (default140).
maxHeight=80..480 bounds the vertically scrolling body; the header stays visible and aligns on horizontal scroll.
Rows may bind to state or array expressions; every row must match columns and contain scalar cells.
Pure collection functions use items (max128) and optional field="object/nestedField", never callbacks.
arraySort(items,field?,direction="asc"|"desc") is stable and requires same-type sortable values.
arrayFind(items,field,value,fallback) returns the first equal item or explicit fallback.
arrayUpdateByKey(items,key="id",value="a",patch={done:true}) returns a new array; keys must be unique
scalars and patch cannot change the key. No match leaves it unchanged. Write with a local_action set.
RichText runs may use strike=true, highlight=true, tabular=true along with bold/italic/underline.
arrayMap projects a required field; arrayFilter requires field,operator,value.
Filter operators: eq/ne/gt/gte/lt/lte/contains. arraySum/arrayAverage use optional field.
arrayJoin requires separator; arrayLength counts items. Missing fields or invalid numbers are unresolved;
empty sum=0, empty average is unresolved. Bound results max32K, strings8192, finite numbers <=1e12.
stringContains(text,query,ignoreCase?), stringReplace(text,search,replacement), stringTrim(text).
Dates are ISO yyyy-MM-dd, years1900..2100. dateAddDays(date,days), dateDiffDays(start,end),
formatDate(date,format="iso"|"yearMonth"|"monthDay"). All arguments are NAMED.
if supports bounded objects/arrays but is eager: both branches must be valid.
RichText runs=[{text:"...",bold:true,italic:false,underline:false,tone:"primary",size:"caption"}].
Run tone: primary|muted|success|info|warning|error; mix colors in one line with RichText runs.
Optional run url is http(s); RichText is not HTML. Put math/Mermaid in normal Markdown.
Image/Video/Audio use user/tool-provided http(s) URLs; load only on click, never autoplay.
Link/File open web URLs, not device paths. Media can fail independently.
Map markers=[{label:"A",latitude:30,longitude:120}], route=true connects points in order:
this is a LOCATION SKETCH, not roads/navigation. Draft saves/copies locally, never sends mail.
Popover(label="Details",child=...) opens an anchored panel inside the card, at most320x240 dp,
with scrolling, a close button and outside-tap dismissal. Short cards expand to fit the panel.
Do not nest Popovers or hide essential information in them. Opening never calls AI.
Frame(child=...,minWidth=0,maxWidth=600,minHeight=0,maxHeight=300,aspectRatio=1.5)
bounds one region; aspectRatio is width/height (0.25..4). Available screen constraints take priority.
Use ratios for graphics/media, not growing prose or forms. Width0..960dp, height0..480dp;
defaults are min0,maxWidth960,maxHeight480. Content is clipped to the requested region.
Vector(label="Accessible description",width=320,height=180,shapes=[...]) draws data-bound geometry.
width/height define the drawing coordinate viewport, not fixed screen pixels. In a Row (also through
a Panel), viewport width is the preferred display width in dp, bounded by available space; standalone
diagrams expand to available width. Frame supplies explicit bounds when needed.
Shape types and point topology stay literal; coordinates, text and style may use bindings/functions.
Viewport integer dimensions1..1000; coordinates stay inside it. Max64 shapes,128 points/shape.
Shapes: {type:"line",x1:0,y1:0,x2:100,y2:100}, {type:"arrow",x1:0,y1:0,x2:100,y2:100},
{type:"rect",x:10,y:10,width:80,height:50}, {type:"circle",cx:50,cy:50,r:20},
{type:"polyline",points:[[0,0],[100,50]]}, {type:"polygon",points:[[0,0],[100,0],[50,50]]},
{type:"text",x:10,y:10,text:"Label",size:16}. Text uses TOP-LEFT coordinates; allow space for it.
Optional tone=neutral|accent|success|info|warning|error, filled=true, stroke=0.5..12.
Curves: {type:"quadratic",x1:0,y1:80,cx:100,cy:0,x2:200,y2:80} or
{type:"cubic",x1:0,y1:80,cx1:60,cy1:0,cx2:140,cy2:160,x2:200,y2:80}.
All endpoints and controls must be within the viewport; curves are stroked, never filled.
No SVG markup, arbitrary paths, scripts, URLs or touch handlers. Use charts for data inspection.

ACTIONS
Button(child=Text(text="..."),variant="primary"|"default"|"borderless",action=Event(...)).
local_action context: {op:"set",path:"/count",value:5}, {op:"add",path:"/count",value:1},
{op:"save"}, {op:"edit"} or {op:"cancel"}. Local interactions never request AI.
ai_submit context: bound structured data; optional required:["/form/name"].
tool_action context: requested tool and args, NOT direct execution. Both preview and require
confirmation, preserve composer drafts and use normal authorization/review.
open_url context {url:"https://..."}; copy context {text:"..."}.
Label consequential actions honestly. Completed cards only; no actions on history replay.
State persists on this device by chat/message/revision/card. Changed source starts new state.
calculatorStep(state,key) is a pure reducer; initialize
{display:"0",stored:"",op:"",replace:false,error:false}; keys 0..9,".","+","-","*","/","=",
"AC","backspace","sign". Set the whole calculator state atomically with local_action.
